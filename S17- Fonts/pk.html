    <p id="pk2">
      Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March
      2014.[57] He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of the
      Jana Sena party.[58] He met with then BJP Prime ministerial candidate
      Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and
      extended his support.[59] He campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam
      Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He opposed
      Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao
      (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in Hindi).[60] His rallies drew
      what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and
      Telangana.[61] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter
      full-time politics starting October 2017 once he completes his film
      commitments.[62] Kalyan brought the Uddanam kidney disease crisis to the
      attention of media and politicians through protests and a hunger strike.
      Government of Andhra Pradesh responded by constructing dialysis centers
      and implementing various schemes for the village.[63][64] In November
      2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will contest in the 2019 general
      elections in Andhra Pradesh.[65] He stated that he was planning to contest
      from all 175 legislatures of Andhra Pradesh without any alliance.[66] He
      opposed central government's move to privatise Dredging Corporation of
      India (DCI)[67] on a golden platter.[68] Kalyan led a protest march to
      condolence farmers who committed suicides or migrated from the
      drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema.[69] He opposed the TDP Government's
      decision on land pooling.[70] Kalyan conducted a march on the historical
      Dowleswaram Barrage in Rajahmundry demanding political accountability.[71]
      He exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserve forest area at
      Vanthada village of Prathipadu in East Godavari district.[72] Kalyan has
      announced the Jana Sena party's 2019 election manifesto at Rajahmundry[73]
      public meeting with many measures to improve the lives of farmers,[74]
      farm labourers, women, youth, and students. His party would contest
      together with left parties[75] Communist Party of India, Communist Party
      of India (Marxist), and Bahujan Samaj Party[76] for the upcoming 2019
      elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. At the
      same time, when he was actively campaigning for the elections all around
      Andhra Pradesh, he fell sick and shared a few health problems. As he was
      getting ready for his next round of campaign at Sattenapalle, he felt
      dizzy and nauseated. When the chopper was down for refilling at Gannavaram
      airport, he was down with vomiting, dehydration, and drowsiness.
      Immediately then, he was hospitalized and treated in Vijayawada. Again the
      campaign resumed after he got well.[77][78] The Jana Sena Party has
      contested 140 constituencies in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative
      Assembly elections. Kalyan has contested two constituencies – Gajuwaka[79]
      and Bhimavaram.[80] He has lost in both to candidates from YSR Congress
      Party.[81] His party was able to win from Razole, making it the only seat
      it has won in the election.[82] Later the same year, on 3 November 2019,
      Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction
      workers against YSR Congress Party governance who have been facing
      unemployment due to shortage of supply of sand in Andhra Pradesh.[83] On
      16 January 2020, Kalyan has announced his party's alliance with BJP, after
      three years of distancing from it. Both the parties fought together in
      elections of 2024.[84] On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to
      Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in
      Kurnool.[85] He demanded an inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation
      (CBI) into the incident.[86] The Jana Sena Party contested 21
      constituencies in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election,
      with Kalyan contesting in Pithapuram constituency. He won by a margin of
      more than 70,000 votes; Jana Sena Party won in all the contested 21
      constituencies and 2 Lok Sabha seats.
